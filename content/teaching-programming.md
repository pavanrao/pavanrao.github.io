# When is my birthday

My first daughter will be turning 7 this fall. As we got closer to her birthday, she kep asking how many days to my birthday. I thought I this is a great opportunity to introduce her to Python. I can help her write a Python program and she will understand that programs help automate repitive tasks. This program will tell her on what day is her birthday this year, and how many days she has to wait.

TODO: More on the program....
Use of repl.it
datetime issue with replit
use of pytz - which corrects the program but makes it complicated to understand
