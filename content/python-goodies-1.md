I listen to pythonbytes podcast as soon as it comes out. A new one comes out every Friday.

In this episode, I came to know about a tiny useful project, Ken Youens-Clark's little utility called [new.py](https://github.com/kyclark/new.py). It is a python script that can help creating a new python script with argparse boilerplate code. I have been skipping argparse as I need to search on the syntax everytime I try to make a cli application. Instead, I just settle with a python script with variables that I change before running.  I am now going to start my new scripts with [new.py](https://github.com/kyclark/new.py). This is just right for small projects. 


When you find an interesting repo, you cannot help explore other repos by the same user.    When I explored Ken's githug repo, I found two more gems. 

- Ken is the author of Mannings book [Tiny Python Projects](http://tinypythonprojects.com/), he has a github repo and youtube videos for each of his tiny projects in his book.  [Github repo for the book](https://github.com/kyclark/tiny_python_projects) 

- He has a great [tutorial](https://github.com/kyclark/make-tutorial) on Make files: 



There are many other gems in this episode. Check it out.
